# **Malware Detection and Classification Project**

## **Overview**

This project aims to develop a static malware detection and classification system using machine learning techniques. 
The system analyzes executable files and determines whether they are benign or malicious based on various features extracted from the files.

## **The Features**

The system utilizes a dataset containing a large number of executable files, both legitimate and malicious, with specific features extracted. These features include:

- **Name**: The name of the executable file.
- **MD5**: The MD5 hash of the file for unique identification.
- **Machine**: The target architecture for which the executable is intended.
- **SizeOfOptionalHeader**: The size of the optional header in the PE file format.
- **Characteristics**: Characteristics of the PE file, such as whether it's a DLL or executable.
and many more features..
After the model is executed an evaluation technique is implemented to check which features are most impactful and the rest of the features that fall below a certain thrushhold of importance as well as correlated features (correlation is measured using a correlation matrix) are removed and the model is rerun to improve its accuracy.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a significant number of malicious files and a smaller number of legitimate files. To address class imbalance, random undersampling is employed to balance the dataset, ensuring an equal number of malicious and legitimate files for training the model.

## **Implementation**

The project is implemented in Python using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and NumPy for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning model development. The classification models explored include but are not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

## **Usage**

To replicate the experiment and train the machine learning models:

1. Preprocess the dataset and extract relevant features from the executable files.
2. Split the dataset into training, testing and validating sets.
3. Train various machine learning models using the training data.
4. Evaluate the models using the testing and validating data and assess their performance metrics.
6. implement any fine-tuning technics if needed.

## **Results**

The performance of the trained models is evaluated based on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A detailed analysis of the results and comparison between different models is provided in the project documentation.

## **Future Work**

Future enhancements to the project may include:

- Exploring more sophisticated feature extraction techniques.
- Investigating advanced machine learning algorithms for better classification accuracy.
- Classifying malicious executable files according to their type (Ransomware,Virus,Worms,Trojans,etc..) 
- Incorporating dynamic analysis techniques to complement static analysis.
